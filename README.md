# FaceDetector
2nd of a series of projects I am using to learn how to implement the Google Mobile Vision API.

This is a working demo that draws yellow boxes around detected faces.

NOTE
1. Image/face must not be slanting.
2. Does not detect the side of a face or image in poor lighting.
3. There are images in the drawable folder you can test with. You can also import your preferred image(s), just remember to set it in the MainActivity.java class. There is a reference to the line that you will need to change.
